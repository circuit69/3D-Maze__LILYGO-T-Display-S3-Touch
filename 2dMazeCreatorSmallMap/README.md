# 2D Maze Creator

This sketch will allow you create or edit the layout of the mazes. The mazes are an array of 32 bit numbers with 1 = wall, 0 = blank.

You can move the red indicator through the maze using the touch screen, the lower button will toggle the block on/off, the upper button will print the maze data to the serial monitor.

TIP: Your maze data is lost on loss of power or reset. Have your microcontroller connected with the serial monitor open, press the button to push the maze to the serial monitor and verify your connection, then begin editing your maze.

You can copy/paste the maze data directly into the 3D Maze or 2D Maze Creator sketches. The microcontroller does not save your maze, you must copy the maze data to the sketches for later.
